## Search Image Engine
This project is a simple search image engine built using Python and the Flask web framework. It allows users to search for images by keyword and displays the results in a user-friendly interface.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Virtualenv
- Flask
### Installing
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com//search-image-engine.git
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
- cd search-image-engine
- virtualenv venv
- source venv/bin/activate (on Linux/Mac)
- venv\Scripts\activate (on Windows)
### Install the required packages:
- pip install -r requirements.txt
### Run the application:
1 python app.py
The application will be available at http:/dhruvgola.github.io/localhost:5000.
### Building
The project includes a script for downloading and indexing images from various sources. To use it, run:

1 python scripts/index_images.py
This will download and index a set of images for testing purposes.

## Using the Engine
